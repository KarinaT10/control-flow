# Operators and Controls. Loops 

## Tasks

### 
Your code must return min between 2 numbers
For example:
```js
getMin(5, 9, 7) // result: 5
getMin(5, 0, -7) // result: -7
```

### Even Odd checker
your code should return "even" if all of the numbers are even, and "odd" if all of the numbers are odd. In other cases, return "even/odd". You have 3 numbers to compare.
For example:
```js
evenOrOdd(1, 3, 11); // result: odd
evenOrOdd(2, 4, 8); // result: even
evenOrOdd(2, 5, 8); // result: even/odd
```

### Range
your code should return "In range" if the number is between number x and number y. otherwise, it should return "Out of range"

For example:
```js
inOrOutRange(5, 10, 8); // result: In range
inOrOutRange(0, 6, 11); // result: Out of range
```

Write your code in `src/index.js.
*All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors.*

## Prepare and test
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)   
2. Fork this repository: operators-controls-loops
3. Clone your newly created repo: https://gitlab.com/<%your_gitlab_username%>/operators-controls-loops/  
4. Go to folder `operators-controls-loops`  
5. To install all dependencies use [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)  
6. Run `npm run test:dev` in the command line    
7. You will see the number of passing and failing tests
